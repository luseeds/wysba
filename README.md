### Overview

WYSBA is the acronym for: Would You Still Be Alive?.

This website aims to raise awareness about the lifespan of farmed animals and their typical slaughter age compared to their natural lifespan. It invites users to reflect on the question: "If you were a farmed animal, would you still be alive?"

### Key Features

- **Interactive Age Comparison**: Users can input their age to see how it compares to the lifespan and slaughter age of various farmed animals.
- **Educational Content**: Provides insights into the natural lifespan of animals versus their typical lifespan when raised for meat, dairy, or eggs.
- **Visual Representations**: Uses images and progress bars to illustrate the stark difference between natural lifespan and slaughter age.

### Animals Featured

- **Chickens**: Used for meat and eggs.
- **Turkeys**: Commonly raised for meat.
- **Cows**: Used for both meat and dairy.
- **Lambs**: Raised for meat.
- **Rabbits**: Often raised for meat.
- **Pigs**: Raised for meat.

### How It Works

- **Input Your Age**: Enter your age to calculate your lifespan ratio.
- **Compare Ratios**: See how your lifespan ratio compares to that of farmed animals.
- **Learn**: Understand the implications of early slaughter ages on animal welfare.

### Educational Goals

- **Awareness**: Increase awareness about the realities of animal farming.
- **Empathy**: Encourage empathy towards farmed animals by highlighting their shortened lifespans.
- **Action**: Inspire users to consider the ethical implications of their food choices.

### Data Source

The data presented is based on average lifespans and typical slaughter ages for farmed animals in the industry. It is [based on this website](https://www.farmtransparency.org/kb/food/abattoirs/age-animals-slaughtered)
